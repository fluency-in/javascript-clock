# JavaScript: Clock

Implement a clock that handles times without dates.

Create a clock that is independent of date.

You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.

Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.

These tests use jasmine-node, which is a testing framework written for Node.js.

You will need:

* Node.js
* The Node Package Manager (NPM)
* jasmine-node

You can install both Node.js and NPM with a download from nodejs.org: https://nodejs.org/en/download

Use NPM to install jasmine-node:

    npm install jasmine-node -g

To work on an exercise, change to the directory of the exercise:

    cd hello-world

This contains the files for the exercise.

    .
    ├── README.md
    └── hello-world.spec.js

To run a test file, pass it as an argument to the `jasmine-node` command:

    jasmine-node hello-world.spec.js
